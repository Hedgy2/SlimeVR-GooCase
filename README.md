# _*Description*_

* *_Separate the pieces on the print bed! Don't print the lids already snapped on._*
* solder the battery with the wires _through_ the case, the battery needs to be soldered last as it won't fit through the wire guiding holes in the case.
  
This is my attempt at making a compact SlimeVR case. The main features are a tight layout, snap on lids/covers for easy repair and assembly easy access ports. I used a magnetic USB-C adapter for easy charging access. I have tested the lids on all 8 pieces I printed and so far they snap on and hold on well for me, but due to the small geometry this might vary from person to person as printer calibrations can vary.

The components I used are all nearly the default from the SlimeVR diy components page, with the main choices being the BMI160 and 804040/1800mah Lipo

0.2 and 0.15mm layer heights worked for me, I would still recommend with the 0.15 if possible, there is not much internal volume so use what ever infill you desire, 10 to 20% is strong enough for me. Also do remember to separate the lids
